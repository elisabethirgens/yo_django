Write my first Django app by following the tutorial on [djangoproject.com](https://djangoproject.com/)

## Using a virtual environment

https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments

- From within that, activate with `source tutorial-env/bin/activate`

## Get started

- `python manage.py runserver`
